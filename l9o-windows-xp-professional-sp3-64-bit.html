I don't know if it was a big deal, but Fallout 3 was on sale on Steam, for .99 yesterday as a flash sale. Anyway, I'm having an issue I was hoping someone might have some information about. I looked around for fixes but none of them seem to have worked. Basically, the game is locking up at apparently random intervals. The screen locks first, with the audio continuing for another 20 seconds or so. You can not alt+tab.

I have a long series of questions! I'm a video / audio producer and occasional PC gamer. I'm on the fence about upgrading my desktop, which I have used maybe three times in the last three years. I primarily use my laptop for everything that isn't media production or gaming. I am tired of the locky-uppy ball of duct-taped-together drivers and whatnot that this computer has become, but I'm terrified of upgrading. Nothing is particularly broken, it's just kind of. icky. What can realistically. I built this computer for my dad as a replacement for his old dell pc with the following specs.

I called Microsoft I have virtual machines, one Win 7 and one Win XP. the internet on Win 7is working just fine. But on XP it refuses to work, I've done a bit research and found people are referring to the "Local Area Connection" witch I don't have.

I am in the situation where I would like to install Windows 7 as my primary OS, with the option of switching to a secondary copy of Windows 10. I need windows 7 to run legacy software and I am comfortable with it, but I would like to be able to boot into Windows 10 for gaming. Ideally I would Hi everybody.

When came time for my HTPC I installed windows with the same CD key from a extra key I had from the sale. The machine installed all was fine for about 24 hours.then Windows then complained that this CD key was invalid. I called Microsoft. PC is freezing in what seems to be an arbitrary fashion. I hit the reset button and reboot and things are fine until the next "arbitrary" freeze. Sometimes it will run for days or a week or more, sometimes a few hours. On occasion, there will be a notice on POST that the proc is overheated. I have cleaned with air the internals and re-done the thermal paste on the proc, but no joy (or rather very little). Just got a little app from CPUID that shows this: This helps. We are in the process of upgrading from 4.5 to 5.1 and we have noticed that PCoIP is not performing as will as it should. Specifically the login times with PCoIP are more than double what they are with RDP going to the same pool with the same user account. Also I have noticed that when logging off with PCoIP the View Manager shows the desktop in a connected state for about a minute after we have been disconnected. Our VM's are Linked Clone XP SP3 with 1vCPU and 1GB of RAM, I am testing I have a vista home premium upgrade disc and keycode for an HP, which I assume is an OEM code. (I'm not an IT professional so am not as well experienced in these things.) My questions are these, I opened the envelope and there was a Vista disc and an upgrade assistant disc. I put the upgrade assistant disc in and it said my version of windows was not comparable, I assume because I have XP sp3 not the original version of XP from when I bought the computer </p>
